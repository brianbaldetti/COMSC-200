# COMSC-200
Code from DVC COMSC-200 class taken over the fall of 2022. This is probably one of my favorite classes that I have taken at DVC and definitely my favorite computer science class at DVC. I think that I learned so many things in C++, how the language works in depth, and a lot of functional coding practices and libraries.

# NOTICE
I have changed all the names of the program and tried to remove any class references so that no one can directly copy and paste my code for this specific professor. Also, I have not posted any of the programs that I wrote for test for obvious reasons.
